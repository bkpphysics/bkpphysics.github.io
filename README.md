- **Supervisor**: Professor/Dr. K.V.P. Latha, Pondicherry University, India.
- **Description**: The main aim of this project is to explain every type of AGN within the same scenario. It is widely accepted that every AGN is powered by accretion onto a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH), and therefore the structure of their nuclei should be similar in all cases. This leads to the Unified Model (UM) of AGN. In this project, we have developed 3D Radiative Transfer Stimulation for dusty tori using SKIRT code. In the model, by varying different parameters (inner radius and outer radius, optical depth, covering factor, half opening angle, distance, etc.) of tori, SEDs (Spectral Energy Distributions) are plotted and compared with the observational data of the different types of AGNs, mostly in the infrared wavelength range. 10-micron silicate absorption and emission features are analyzed thoroughly for different lines of sight. We found that our model agrees very well with the observational data for the wavelength of less than 10-micron.

    **Project Title**: Non-thermal synchrotron emission of ultra-relativistic particles associated with Coronal Mass
     Ejection

    *Description*: Moving Type IV Coronal radio bursts are observed from the collected data of different telescopes (Radio)
      present all over the world. The theory of Synchrotron radiation Power Spectrum is derived using modified
      Bessel’s function of second kind and Integral representation of the Airy function. From the observed data of
      type IV radio burst Graphs are plotted between Radiation power spectrum and frequency, compared with
      the theoretical Calculation, and hence confirms that type IV burst emission are due to synchrotron radio
      emission from ultra-relativistic particles. The influence of Cosmic Plasmas on the propagation and emission
      of electromagnetic waves also analysed using the theory of Cherenkov radiation theory.
